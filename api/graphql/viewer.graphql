#
# A GraphQL type representing the Viewer or User of the Client who is accessing the APIs. All of
# the APIs should be scoped with respect to the `Viewer`. For example, the `feed` field on the
# `Query` object should return items relevant to this `Viewer`.
#
# `name` - The name to use for this `Viewer`. This value is up to the server implementation and can
# be anything that will be visible to the `Viewer`. For example, this could be the full name, first
# name, username, email, or any other User defined value. Howerver, it is recommended not to expose
# secure information, such as, an email.
#
# `isAuthenticated` - Indicates whether this `Viewer` is authenticated (logged-in) or not.
#
# `subscribedChannels` - A `ChannelConnection` linking to the `Channels` that this User has
# subscribed to.
